# ü§ñ Automated Fiber Encapsulation for Fused Layer Modeling (FLM)

---

This repository contains the documentation, design files, and core firmware for an engineering project focused on the **automated encapsulation of continuous carbon fibers**. This system serves as a crucial **pre-processing step** for the production of high-strength composite components using Fused Layer Modeling (FLM) 3D printing.

## ‚ú® Project Goal & Context

---

The primary objective was to **design, implement, and validate** an automated machine capable of coating carbon fiber roving with a thermoplastic granulate. This process ensures the fibers are uniformly prepared for subsequent integration into a specialized FLM extruder, thereby enabling the production of mechanically superior, fiber-reinforced 3D prints.

The project followed a robust engineering design process:

* **1. Technical Foundations:** Comprehensive analysis of the FLM process and the **Markforged concept**‚Äîa key inspiration for embedding reinforced, encapsulated fibers to enhance component strength.

* **2. System Design & Requirements:**
    * **Requirements:** Critical system parameters were defined, including the necessity for reliable heating of the granulate (up to $185\ \text{¬∞C}$), kink-free fiber deflection, and a consistent feed mechanism.
    * **Concept Selection:** A functional analysis led to the selection of a **stepper motor with planetary gear** for superior, precise fiber feeding control.

* **3. Implementation & Realization (Hardware/Software):**
    * **Hardware:** Custom 3D-printed parts were designed for the spool-to-motor connection. A stepper motor with a calculated torque of $M = 35\ \text{Ncm}$ was selected and integrated.
    * **Software/Control:** **Marlin firmware** was adapted and uploaded to an Arduino board to control the stepper motor, heating cartridges, thermistor, and cooling fan.

### üîå Component Realization & Connection

The physical system was realized by integrating the heating block, motor, and control electronics.

## üíª Software & Control Interface

The system is controlled via adapted Marlin firmware, allowing for precise regulation of temperature and feed rate.

### PID Temperature Control

The firmware successfully managed the heating block to melt the granulate, reaching the required temperature with minimal overshoot.

**Key Findings:**
* **Process Validation:** The system reliably reached $185\ \text{¬∞C}$ and effectively pulled the carbon fibers through the granulate melt pool.
* **Quality Output:** The final die successfully produced a **high-quality, evenly coated fiber**, suitable for reinforcing FLM-printed parts.
* **Thermal Stability:** A stable connection between the thermistor and the heating block proved crucial for accurate temperature readings and PID stability.
